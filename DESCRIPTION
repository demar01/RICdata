Description: RICdata is a data package containing the data to analyse RNA 
            interaction capturefrom the manuscript titled: Global analysis of 
            RNA-binding protein dynamics by comparative and enhanced RNA 
            interactome capture. This paper was published in Nature Protocols 
            16,27â€“60(2021). The data objects of thisi package have been processed
            and peptide data was downloaded from PRIDE under the accession
            identifiers PXD009789. The data contained in this package are 
            required to run functions in `RIC` package which contains the code
            used to analyse RNA interaction capture data.
